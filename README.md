## 📈 Analysis Questions & Insights
### Customer Demographics Analysis 

## 1. Proportion of male and female customers
The customer base is almost evenly split between male and female customers, with no major dominance by either gender.

## 2. Senior citizens churn comparison
Senior citizens show a higher churn rate compared to non-senior customers, indicating they are more likely to leave the service.

## 3. Customer segmentation by tenure
Most customers fall into lower tenure ranges (0–12 months), while fewer customers stay for longer periods.

## 4. Churn rate by tenure segment
Churn is highest among low-tenure customers and decreases as tenure increases, showing loyalty grows over time.

## 5. Average monthly charges vs tenure
Customers with shorter tenure generally have higher monthly charges, while long-tenure customers tend to pay slightly less.

## 6. Monthly charges vs tenure by gender
Both genders show a similar pattern: higher monthly charges and lower tenure are associated with higher churn.

## 7. Key customer metrics with filters
KPIs such as total customers, churned customers, churn rate, average tenure, and average monthly charges update dynamically using gender and contract type slicers.


### Service Subscription Analysis — Answers

## 1. Phone service subscription
Most customers are subscribed to phone service, while a smaller portion are not.

## 2. Internet service vs churn rate
Fiber optic customers have the highest churn rate, followed by DSL, while customers without internet service have the lowest churn.

## 3. Add-on services used by churned customers
Churned customers often lack add-on services such as online security and tech support.

## 4. Services count vs churn likelihood
Customers with fewer subscribed services are more likely to churn.

## 5. Service combinations linked to churn
Customers with fiber optic internet and no additional services show the highest churn tendency.

## 6. Internet usage distribution and churn
Fiber optic users form a large segment and also contribute significantly to churn.

## 7. Filtered churn behavior comparison
Using slicers (gender, senior citizen, internet service, contract), churn patterns become clearer across different customer groups.

### Contract & Billing Insights

## 1. Churn rate by contract type
Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn, while one-year and two-year contracts have much lower churn.

## 2. Payment method and churn distribution
Electronic check users show higher churn compared to customers using credit cards or bank transfers.

## 3. Average total charges by contract
Customers with long-term contracts have higher total charges due to longer tenure.

## 4. Monthly charges by payment method
Monthly charges vary across payment methods, with electronic check users often paying higher amounts.

## 5. Paperless billing and churn
Customers using paperless billing have a slightly higher churn rate.

## 6. Tenure by contract type
Long-term contracts are strongly associated with longer customer tenure.

## 7. Billing KPIs with filters
Billing KPIs dynamically update using contract type and payment method filters.

### Churn Prediction & Key Drivers 

## 1. Overall churn rate
The overall churn rate indicates a significant portion of customers leave the service.

## 2. Strongest churn drivers
Contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and internet service type are the strongest factors influencing churn.

## 3. High-risk customer segments
Low-tenure, month-to-month, fiber optic customers with high monthly charges are most likely to churn.

## 4. Revenue impact
Lost customers contribute to revenue loss, while retained long-term customers generate higher lifetime value.

## 5. Churn risk score
Customers with higher churn risk scores are concentrated in short-tenure and high-charge segments.

## 6. Churn concentration
Churn is most concentrated among customers with multiple risk factors combined.
